      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a Web3 enthusiast and builder with over six months of hands-on experience in blockchain, 
        DeFi, and digital innovation. My journey started with a passion for decentralization and has 
        evolved into creating solutions that merge creativity with technology.  
        I’ve worked with projects like <strong>KEGN</strong>, <strong>CryptoLandDAO</strong>, and several NFT 
        initiatives, where I focused on community engagement, design, and smooth user experiences.  
        Every project I touch is aimed at making blockchain simpler, more accessible, and more exciting 
        for people worldwide. I’m constantly exploring new technologies, experimenting with smart 
        contracts, and contributing to the growth of crypto culture.  
        For me, Web3 isn’t just the future — it’s happening right now, and I’m proud to be part of it.
